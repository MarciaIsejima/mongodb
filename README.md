This is a chat application used to practice basic MongoDB operations (query, insert, update and delete documents).
The chat application was developed using NodeJS with Express and implemented database access using MongoDB native driver as well as Mongoose.

## To install the application
1. Install MongoDB server locally
2. Clone this repository and cd to the new application directory
3. Run `npm install` to install the application and the dependencies
